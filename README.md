## About the Video Course
Go is a modern, open source, statically typed language that resembles C. It is particularly useful in developing cloud-native applications as it’s convenient, occupies a low footprint, and deploys fast.

Go greatly simplifies the development of modern applications. With its vast ecosystem of tools and libraries, it's easy to create an efficient software pipeline that satisfies business requirements.

This course will elevate your knowledge of Go by teaching you the advanced concepts of the language. You'll also understand how you can utilize them in practice. It starts by introducing familiar features of the language before delving into more details. You’ll master the art of programming with Go, which includes understanding the Go language, writing idiomatic yet readable code, building web applications, microservices, command-line applications, and more.

By the end of the course, you'll be ready to engineer efficient Go solutions that can move mountains.
